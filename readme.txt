Arf Arf
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Grrrr)
Uh, Yeah don't get it twisted
This rap shit, is mine
Motherfucker, it's not, a fucking, game
F*ck what you heard
It's what you hearin'
It's what you hearin' (Listen)
It's what you hearin' (Listen)
It's what you hearin' (Listen)

[Verse 1]
X gon give it to ya
F*ck waitin' for you to get it on your own
X gon' deliver to ya
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
Wit the non-stop, pop pop and stainless steel
Go hard gettin busy wit it
But I got such a good heart that
I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right and I'll do it again
'cause I am right so I gots to win
Break bread wit the enemy
But no matter how many cats I break bread wit
I'll break who you sendin me
You motherfucker never wanted nothin
But your wife said, bitch, and that's for the light day
I'm gettin down, down
Make a nigga say freeze
But won't be the one endin up on his knees, bitch
Please, If the only thing you cats did was came out to play
Stay out my way, motherfucker

[Chorus]
First we gonna ROCK, Then we gonna ROLL
Then we let it POP, DON'T LET IT GO
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya
(Repeat Once)

[Verse 2]
Ain't never gave nothin to me
But everytime I turn around
Cats got they hands out wantin something from me
I ain't got it so you can't get it
Lets leave it at that 'cause I ain't wit it
Hit it wit full strength
I'm a jail nigga
So I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you
Whatever, whenever
Nigga, f*ck you gon' do?
I'm a wolf in sheeps clothing
Only nigga that you know who can chill
Come back and get the streets open
I've been doing this for nineteen years
Niggaz wanna fight me? Fight these tears
I put in work and it's all for the kids
But these cats done forgot what work is (UH-HUH!)
They don't know who we be
Lookin! but they don't know who they see, nigga

[Chorus]
First we gonna ROCK, Then we gonna ROLL
Then we let it POP, DON'T LET IT GO
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya
(Repeat Once)

[Verse 3]
Aiiyo where my niggaz at?!
I know I got them down in the game
Give em love and they give it back
Toke too much for too long
Don't give up your too strong (What?!)
A dog to the bow bow honeyz
Shoutout to niggaz that done it
And it ain't even about the do'
It's about gettin down for what you stand for yo

[Chorus]
First we gonna ROCK, Then we gonna ROLL
Then we let it POP, DON'T LET IT GO
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya
He gon' give it to ya
(Repeat Twice)
