--Notes
-All JSON arrays are associative arrays
-All functions that do not succeed will return a JSON array with the key result connected -to an error message
-<input> generally refers to a JSON array, any other input is a specific value
-most deletions cascade through the database, and will delete other entries where they're referenced, e.g. deleting a user will delete all contacts that the user is involed in, all groups he owns, etc.
